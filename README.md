## Portraying my code how I can, where I find it's ready to go. 

While making new projects, I'm often seeking out my best positive outlook. A variety of functional tech stack can be found here - including MERN, Inquirer CLI apps, REST API/Express back ends, Handlebars templating, and some Python. Much code here was sourced from learning materials provided by a boot camp program, other projects involve structures which were sourced from Codecademy.
