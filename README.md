## Portraying my code how I can, where I find it's ready to go. 

During many tutorial projects that I have undertaken, I often sought out my best positive outlook. Some varieties of tech stack being portrayed here include MERN or React, Node.js/Inquirer, Handlebars template, and some Codecademy projects. Much code here was sourced from learning materials provided by a boot camp experience that I have recently completed. 

### In the works:
- studying React
- algorithms
- reviewing previously covered topics via Codecademy
- intro to Python
