Thanks for taking an interest in my GitHub profile. Of the projects listed, the substantial amount of them are derived from the various challenge assignments and module content from an online course which was undertaken to learn web development (UConn Coding Boot Camp 2021-2022). More projects will be added as my scope for learning materials is broadened. 

## New materials which I am interested in:
alternative frameworks to React (Angular, Vue, Ember), Tailwind CSS
## Recent skills which I have expanded upon: 
React, MongoDB, Apollo Client
